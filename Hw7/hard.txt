Deleting a node from a tree is hard because we need the tree to be organized.

There are a few cases to ensure tree organization listed below:
1. The node has no children - you can remove it!
2.The node has one child - You need to connect the parent of the node to its child (like up one on the tree)
3. The node has two children - you need to find the next node in the inorder order and replace the node with it. Then delete it (the old one).

There are some issues that could arrise. You could unbalance a tree and cause inefficiensies. In that case you would have to do the best you can.
Finding an inorder successor could be hard as well but you can use a search function to find it.
